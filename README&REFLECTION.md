# React Component Basics

This React Lab Demonstrates:

1. Creation of reusable React components with TypeScript interfaces for props. 
2. Implmentation of proper prop handling and validation. 
3. use of effective component composition. 
4. Application of TypeScript best practices for component development. 
5. Documentation of components with clear prop interfaces

#What you'll find

Components - 3 seperate components with descriptions in their respective files. 
Typescript interface - used to enforce structure and type safety. 
Component and composition practice - prop drilling used as well as real world examples. 

#How to Run

# Reflection

I feel like where i was little confused on what we were doing in class, getting the practice in really helped to give insight to the why React is this way. I can also see that at first, it may be a little tough to get, but once it clicks, it will make building things so much easier. 

I wanted to find a picture to show one in the product, but because of time, took advantage of the fact the the prop was optional. Layout is an inportant consideration, as well maintaining the box model in mind when building html elements through jsx. Utilizing TS interfaces is really awesome to help ensure type safety, as well as creating out gui elements. 

All in all, a pretty insightful lab, helping to pinpoint key syntactical structure points of React.
